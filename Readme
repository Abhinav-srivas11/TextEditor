Hi there reader,

I assume you are reading this file to get a better understanding of this project.
Let me help you get a bit of a headstart.


The final Text Editor code can be found by following the below path:
TextEditor/Text Editor/task/src/editor/

The other folders inside the TextEditor folder refer to the various stage implementations of the text editor application.
Inside each folder is the instruction file for adding functionalities to the text editor.

This project required me to do a lot of research on my own for materials that were not covered in the tutorial itself.
At the same time it tested my knowledge and how well I could combine every concept that I knew at that moment of time.
This tutorial provided the perfect combination of learning and implementation.
It allowed me to create the code on my own with very little spoon feeding, which benefitted me by increasing my confidence and my ability to raise questions in a specific manner.

Text Editor application has allowed me to practice all concepts of Java from the very basic.

I am currently reading up on stage 4 concepts after which I shall be able to make this a fully working application as we see in our everyday lives.

I shall update this file with more information soon.
